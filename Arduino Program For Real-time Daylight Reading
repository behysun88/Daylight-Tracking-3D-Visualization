This is a program to utilize TSL2561, HC 05  Bluetooth Device and Arduino Uno to give us the ability of real-time reading of daylight.
Note to remember: 
                  1- I tried, Arduino Leonardo, Arduino Mega and Arduino Mega R3, have issues with their firmware so far up to this day.
                  2- Design a shield for your Arduino, the Bluetooth seems to be very sensetive and spotty when there is a minor lose wire
                  3-
